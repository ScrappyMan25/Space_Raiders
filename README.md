### Personal Note:

Pico - 8 being a fantasy console offers limited choice with respect to game design. The
flexibility of coding with the limitation of the design forced me to be as creative as
possible with the resources available.

Starting on a basic engine like pico-8 helped me solidify the understanding of necessary
key fundamentals of game design and development that will be crucial in this
industry. The simple nature of pico-8 enabled me to think in a more grounded and
elementary sense.

This game took me 2 weeks of development and I learnt a lot from it. This was completed on the 31st of December '20 but even though I've done a lot since then - I'm still very proud of this! 

### About the Game:

The game is a 2D space themed shooter made on pico-8 [Language Lua Based].

The music in the game is NOT produced by me.
